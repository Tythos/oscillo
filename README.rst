Oscillo is a lightweight, portable data analysis toolkit. Based on the Impulse
web application, the ideal use case is drag-and-drop analysis of complex
datasets to produce quality and insightful visualizations.

The Oscilloscope
----------------

Have you ever used an oscilloscope? I mean, have you ever REALLY used an
oscilloscope? There are few tools in engineering that offer such a powerful and
flexible method of gaining insight into a complex circuit, electronic component,
sensor, or controller. Take an oscilloscope, attach to the interesting segment
of your problem, and tune the oscilloscope knobs to reach that sudden moment of
enlightenment when the waveform solidifies into a solid photonic mass of
insight into a problem you had thought unsolvable.

Why can't we have that same tool for data problems--infinitely more complex,
with infinitely more possibility for hidden nuggets of value?
